9-2-11 ------- Using Bundler -----------------#
The app now requires bundler to manage gems, to update your version follow the steps
Many gems will change Rails, now 2.3.14, searchlogic etc. - best to start with a new rvm gemset
Otherwise, look at versions in Gemfile and Gemfile.lock and remove gems that do not match, then
1) gem install bundler
2) bundle install
As development progresses, you may have to run bundle install or bundle update to capture
new versions of gems that we needed for one reason or another.
